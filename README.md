# The project

In this initial phase of the project, we are developing a simulation of an Airbnb application. Our objective is to establish a method for controlling the modules utilized by our web page through the implementation of a JSON-formatted database. During this process, we apply object-oriented programming, Python data translation, and command interpretation logic to create a local database that can be modified through command inputs.

`Storage engine -> Json file.`
`Console -> cmd with python library cmd.Cmd`

# Requierements

```
sudo apt-get install python3
